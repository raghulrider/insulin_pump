Brush dc motors 
 has iron and ironless
ironless for better efficiency as it has no ironloss and very low inductance. Efficiency upto 90% 

BLDC
available ftrom 8mm to 35mm
reduced dependency on bearings and brushes with the help of electronic commutation 
has slot and slotless
slotless has advantage of no cogging or detent torque, and has less iron loss than the slotted design

Stepper motors
also a BLDC
has many poles and has many stable position per revolution
could not run at high speed
Best stepper motor with disc magnet - low ironloss and inertia,higher efficinecy



important parameters:
normal blood glucose level - 60-110mg/dl (milligram/decilitre) 1mg/dl = 0.01 kg/m3
cannula should be replaced afte 72 hours (3 days) and Reservoir should be replaced after 7 days to prevent occlusion
reservoir - 300 units(3ml)
ATmega16 
insulin infusion rate u(t)
One of the better-known, more effective diabetes control
systems is a Relative proportional control law(RPC)

The Daily Dose :
Q(U) = [A(mg/dl)-100]x10xB(Kg)x0.6÷1000÷2]
Where, A=BG, B=Weight of patient

The Volume of insulin syringe (VI)- to be
delivered decides total linear displacement of
piston VI=0.013mm. Linear travel by motor /step

Insulin piston displacement per step decides the
insulin delivery rate as per the range of the system:
Delivery /Step = 0.2µl/min to 200µl/min
(0.029U/min-20U/min)

optional:
reciprocating piston pump
